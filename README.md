# Description

This project was created to create, read, update, and delete data related to each user. Users can now share their thoughts, create a friends list, and react to their friends thoughts. This program uses a NoSQL database called MongoDB to store this information and data. Using the mongoose ORM, we can map out and create schemas and using express to create crud routes. See tutorial below!
